# Learning to use Redux with React

This project is a school learning project. The App doesn't really do anything sane, 
but it serves it purpose for describing the basic structure of how to use react-redux.

Teacher and code-material for the lectures: Margit Tennosaar
(Code is mainly copied from her code.)
